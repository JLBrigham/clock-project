# clock-project

project gave me lots of new things to look up on CSS

used box sizing in css for the first time cox sizing includes padding and boarder in elements total width and height - write about what i learnt here

first time using after and before selectors

when positioning something absolutely, need to give the element that it is

z-index- makes things on top

look at transform

min-height
